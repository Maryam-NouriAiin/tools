## Loading Datasets in R

Using built-in datasets:
```{r}
data(mtcars)
```


## Basic Plotting in R

Simple scatter plot:
```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg)
```
Customizing the plot:
Add labels and title: plot(mtcars$mpg, main="MPG Plot", xlab="Car Index", ylab="MPG").
Explore the dataset: head(mtcars), summary(mtcars).
Whatâ€™s inside the dataset? Overview of rows and columns.


## Creating and Managing Projects in RStudio
